## Overview

**Data Formulator** is an application from Microsoft Research that uses large language models to transform data, expediting the practice of data visualization.

With most modern visualization tools, authors need to transform their data into tidy formats to create visualizations they want. Because this requires experience with programming or separate data processing tools, data transformation remains a barrier in visualization authoring. To address this challenge, we present a new visualization paradigm, concept binding, that separates high-level visualization intents and low-level data transformation steps, leveraging an AI agent. 

With Data Formulator, authors first define data concepts they plan to visualize using natural languages or examples, and then bind them to visual channels. Data Formulator then dispatches its AI-agent to automatically transform the input data to surface these concepts and generate desired visualizations. When presenting the results (transformed table and output visualizations) from the AI agent, Data Formulator provides feedback to help authors inspect and understand them. A user study with 10 participants shows that participants could learn and use Data Formulator to create visualizations that involve challenging data transformations, and presents interesting future research directions.

## Get Started

Choose one of the following options to set up Data Formulator:

- **Option 1: Codespaces**
  
  Use Codespaces for an easy setup experience, as everything is preconfigured to get you up and running quickly. For more details, see [CODESPACES.md](CODESPACES.md).
  
  [![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/microsoft/data-formulator?quickstart=1)

- **Option 2: Local Installation**
  
  Opt for a local installation if you prefer full control over your development environment and the ability to customize the setup to your specific needs. For detailed instructions, refer to [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md).


## Usage

Once youâ€™ve completed the setup using either option, follow these steps to start using Data Formulator:

### The basics of data visualization
* Choose a dataset
* Choose a visualization
* Add data fields to your visualization

### Add the special sauce 
* Create new concepts and click the **Formulate** button
* Inspect the code behind the concept
* Add the new concept fields to your visualization

Repeat this process as needed to explore and understand your data. Your explorations are trackable in the **Data Threads** panel.
